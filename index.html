		<P> "There is only one way to learn," the alchemist answered. "It's through action. Everything you need to know you have learned through your journey -The alchemist- "If you could only sense how important you are to the lives of those you meet; how important you can be to the people you may never even dream of. There is something of yourself that you leave at every meeting with another person." -Fred Rogers-</P>
